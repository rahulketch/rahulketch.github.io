We want to start off by saying that there isn't any specific dress code, and we want everyone to be able to wear whatever that they feel comfortable in! That being said, a big part of the fun of attending an Indian weddings can be the dressing up in all the fun outfits, so we put together a small guide to help you!

There are the kind of outfits one would see at Indian weddings. If there is something long and flowy, colourful or patterned already in your wardrobe it would probably fit right in at one of the events!




Mehandi and Haldi are pretty casual day time events and do not call for muchdressing up. There is a suggested dress code for Haldi (shades of sun) as a lot of people might be wearing yellow or orange. 

Sangeet is an event where there is a lot of music and dancing. You could dress like you would to a wedding in the west for this event, maybe pick an outfit that would be fun to twirl in!

For the actual wedding event on 21st February evening, it might be nice to dress up in traditional Indian attire. My mother has generously agreed to lend from her large saree collection to any of you who wants to wear one. There will be somebody helping you drape the saree around you as well! Do let us know if you're interested (and if there are colours you particularly like or don't like), we will set one aside for you. Please bring a neutral colour crop top and leggings to wear underneath the saree!

If you want to shop for an outfit, head to a mall close to you in any Indian city and there will be a lot of options! If you are short of time, here are two websites where you can look for an outfit, and let us know and we can order it for you and bring to the venue!
